 th_arc.5.desc: "When our researchers entered the site to explore, the vision of all the people changed, and after a trance, they found that they had come to a strange place, but they couldn't move. Meanwhile a voice sounded in their ears: \n \"All right, most of the work is done.\"\n\"So all that's left is the personal account and the essay, then. Or perhaps I should say, your parts are the only ones we haven't made progress on, Merry.\"\n\"Whoops. Found out, did you?\"\n\"Remind me which of us suggested this project to begin with?\"\n\n\nMuch like how an excess supply of goods causes the goods' value to drop, all of humanity coming into wealth is equivalent to rich people disappearing from the world. Ever since the digitization of information, one could obtain vast quantities of it nigh-instantaneously. At the same time, things like speed and volume, which had held absolute authority since primitive times, lost their value. What gained value in exchange was quality. More than anything else, special information held by only a select few was what excited society's qualitative celebrities."

There's no dystopia more dull than a world where everything works out just how everyone wants it.\"\n\n\nIn a world where the digitization of info had progressed to its limits, there was no such thing as an e-book. \"E-books\" were nothing more than things created based on original, physical books. So when one said \"book\", they meant one made of paper.\n\nAt the suggestion of Maribel Hearn (Merry), the two decided to make a book about the mysterious worlds they had seen. It seemed that they had come to realize that the worlds they saw weren't just dreams."

Since those are all facts that dominate the world, couldn't they go so far as to call Merry's visions truth surpassing those facts? To Renko Usami, Merry appeared to be a scholar of truth, who would open the eyes of all the delusion-spouting physicists.\n\n\"If ​​writing it out is a pain, how about dictating it for now?

Shrines and the like were definitely holy ground.\nMerry said she saw a cat at a shrine.\nHowever, the cat never caught anyone's attention and freely passed through objects.\nMerry knew what it was at once. It was a youkai cat, she said, lurking within quantum gaps.\n\n\"Huh, a quantumly-unobservable cat...\nUntil it's observed, it's both alive and dead.\nJust like Schrödinger's Cat.\"\n\"Although since I observed it, that determined it was alive.\""

Our expedition team members barely crossed the path and began to move towards it. \n\nThe vanguard personnel first reported that they had found a huge dead cherry tree soaked in spiritual power. Its dead wooden roots were covered with fungi emitting various colors of fluorescence, stretching for dozens of meters. Near the roots of the ancient tree, some glass-shaped active plants reflected the fluorescence of the fungi and seemed to be somewhat aggressive towards us.
