 th_arc.4.name: "Abnormal Space Fluctuations"
 th_arc.4.desc: "Just as we were busy with our daily production activities, our satellites discovered an abnormal space fluctuations seemed to be happening right here in our capital. As our scientists went to check, a piece of ruin, where there should have been nothing, appeared out of nowhere."
 th_arc.4.a: "We must figure out the reason!"
 th_arc.5.name: "The Childlike Duo's Naturalis Historia"
 th_arc.5.desc: "When our researchers entered the site to explore, the vision of all the people changed, and after a trance, they found that they had come to a strange place, but they couldn't move. Meanwhile a voice sounded in their ears: \n\"All right, most of the work is done.\"\n\"So all that's left is the personal account and the essay, then. Or perhaps I should say, your parts are the only ones we haven't made progress on, Merry.\"\n\"Whoops. Found out, did you?\"\n\"Remind me which of us suggested this project to begin with?\"\n\n\nMuch like how an excess supply of goods causes the goods' value to drop, all of humanity coming into wealth is equivalent to rich people disappearing from the world. Ever since the digitization of information, one could obtain vast quantities of it nigh-instantaneously. At the same time, things like speed and volume, which had held absolute authority since primitive times, lost their value. What gained value in exchange was quality. More than anything else, special information held by only a select few was what excited society's qualitative celebrities."

 th_arc.6.name: "The Frozen Eternal Capital"
 th_arc.6.desc: "Story Continues:\n\"You're the one who said you wanted to make a book together, right, Merry?\"\n\"Well, yes. Writing it all out is just so tiring, though...\"\n\"Work that's not tiring isn't enjoyable at all. There's no dystopia more dull than a world where everything works out just how everyone wants it.\"\n\n\nIn a world where the digitization of info had progressed to its limits, there was no such thing as an e-book. \"E-books\" were nothing more than things created based on original, physical books. So when one said \"book\", they meant one made of paper.\n\nAt the suggestion of Maribel Hearn (Merry), the two decided to make a book about the mysterious worlds they had seen. It seemed that they had come to realize that the worlds they saw weren't just dreams."

 th_arc.7.name: "Dr. Latency's Sleepless Eye"
 th_arc.7.desc: "Story Continues:\nShrine maidens, itako, mediums, psychics, economists... People who could see supposedly-nonexistent things have been around since long ago. All of them had eventually been treated like frauds. The things Merry saw, too, had sometimes been diagnosed as delusions brought on by a virus.\nHowever, while relaxing with drinks, they sometimes thought: If things are denied because they can't be seen, then unobservable physical principles and astronomical objects far out of reach may as well be bunk, too.\nIn the opinion of Usami Renko, Merry is a truth-ist who can make those crazy physicists come to their senses. Since those are all facts that dominate the world, couldn't they go so far as to call Merry's visions truth surpassing those facts? To Renko Usami, Merry appeared to be a scholar of truth, who would open the eyes of all the delusion-spouting physicists.\n\n\"If writing it out is a pain, how about dictating it for now? I can just transcribe it later.\"\n\"Oh, you can do that, Renko? You're a lifesaver. Let's start right away, then. Lately, I...\""

 th_arc.8.name: "September Pumpkin"
 th_arc.8.desc: "Story Continues:\nIs it possible to see different things in the same place? Merry said that she'd recently started to see multiple worlds at the same time. According to her, all people are seeing slightly different worlds. Particularly interesting was that despite this, they can apparently still communicate with each other.\nMerry started to tell a mysterious story. It was about a strange world that only some humans could see. Not only was it extremely small, but our common sense didn't apply there. A bizarre world where elementary particles flew across boundaries of both time and space.\n\n\"...By 'only some humans,' do you mean physicists?\"\n\"Correct. Good on you, Renko. But, did you know that there are actually strange creatures lurking in that senseless world?\""
 th_arc.8.a: "..."
 th_arc.9.name: "An Instant that Exceeds Planck's Time"
 th_arc.9.desc: "Story Continues:\nMerry said that if we refer to the world we humans observe, which is dominated by photons, as \"the world here,\" then there are also countless \"worlds beyond\" dominated by other types of particles. And in those \"worlds beyond,\" there are life-forms living there as well.\n\n\"Those life-forms that are invisible, but exist very close to us, and can appear to us via fluctuations are youkai, in my opinion.\"\n\"Youkai...\nThat suddenly makes it sound kind of crazy.\"\n\"Well, you could call them angels or devils or phantoms or cryptids, whatever's fine. But when I think of something that can't be seen, yet definitely exists as a phenomenon, I'd say 'youkai' is the best descriptor.\"\n\nThe existence of youkai certainly had been supported since long ago.However, as the world was dominated by science and philosophy that demanded falsifiability, the topic of youkai faded away."
 th_arc.9.a: "..."
 th_arc.10.name: "Schrödinger's Strange Cat"
 th_arc.10.desc: "Story Continues:\n\"So as I was thinking, 'where did the youkai disappear to?', I became able to see it. A world where youkai live even now.\"\n\"Perhaps that could be another brane world...\"\n\"Another what?\"\n\"Oh, just one of the worlds only physicists can see.\"\n\nWhether for some geographical or geological reason, or even pure coincidence, places where different worlds were easily visible had been called 'holy ground' since long ago. Shrines and the like were definitely holy ground.\nMerry said she saw a cat at a shrine.\nHowever, the cat never caught anyone's attention and freely passed through objects.\nMerry knew what it was at once. It was a youkai cat, she said, lurking within quantum gaps.\n\n\"Huh, a quantumly-unobservable cat...\nUntil it's observed, it's both alive and dead.\nJust like Schrödinger's Cat.\"\n\"Although since I observed it, that determined it was alive.\""
 th_arc.10.a: "..."
 th_arc.11.name: "The Shining Needle Castle Sinking in the Air"
 th_arc.11.desc: "Story Continues:\nApparently, the \"worlds beyond\" didn't just have living things, but all manner of strange objects that defied common sense.\n\n\"I saw a castle floating in the sky once, too.\nUpside-down, at that.\"\n\"If the gravitons have a different structure, the world's properties would be different, too.\nThat might've been the kind of brane you saw.\"\n\"It felt mysterious and nostalgic.\nAnd I really liked the wooden tenshu.\"\n\"Wait, tenshu?\nSince you said castle, I thought you meant like Cinderella's.\"\n\"If I had to say which it resembled, it was more like Matsumoto.\"\nMerry had been enjoying her talk about the mysterious world, but she shivered when she briefly remembered something else.\nIt seemed that not all of her memories were fun ones."
 th_arc.11.a: "..."
 th_arc.12.name: "The Forbidden Membrane Wall"
 th_arc.12.desc: "Story Continues:\nAccording to physicists who can see hallucinations, this world is supposedly composed of very thin membranes, and a great many of them.\nPerhaps Merry is seeing one of those brane worlds.\n\nAccording to her, \"there's a slight boundary between the world here and those beyond, and something that strongly resists travel between them along that boundary. If I could just get the hang of it, I could easily cross over.\"\n\"Maybe that transit-resisting 'something' could be the Sanzu River?\"\n\"The people from long ago who could see probably did name it that, yes\"\nPerhaps a brane is something like a dyed object exposed to the flow of a river.\nThe patterns dyed on the object flow down the river and transfer to another object. Merry's behavior might be that sort of thing, simply put. Of course, it's hardly simple to do.\nBut when the pattern seeps into the other object, what happens?\nIt'd probably be seen as just a stain, not a pattern.\n\n(\"...if contaminants get mixed in, they've got to be eliminated\")\n\n\"Huh? What's wrong, Merry? You seem miles away.\"\n\"Oh, what? Sorry, where was I?\"\n\"You were talking about the things you saw in the \"world beyond\". The theme of this book is the record of natural history to gather what you saw there, after all.\""

 th_arc.13.name: "The Sea that Reflects One's Home Planet"
 th_arc.13.desc: "Story Continues:\nShe saw a forest rich with diversity.\nShe saw a proud, holy mountain, shut off to creatures who preferred the lower ground.\nShe saw a deep lake covered in an arcane mist.\nThose sights weren't just beautiful, but natural too. They were all hidden in the invisible gaps of the quantum world.\nBy the way, just what would happen if one went to a brane dominated by particles with different properties?\nMerry remembered, and her face contorted in terror."
 th_arc.13.a: "..."
 th_arc.14.name: "Pure Furies ~ Whereabouts of the Heart"
 th_arc.14.desc: "Story Continues:\n\"When they see me, the youkai living there will attack.\"\n\"What? ...Actually, you kind of have a habit of getting attacked by monsters, Merry.\"\n\"Well, I'm used to it by now. I suppose it is only natural that they'd realize I'm a foreign presence. Like I see youkai as fluctuations,\nperhaps they see me as a phantom-like being.\"\nShe said the attacking youkai came soaring through the sky, just like formless quantum particles racing to and fro in a vacuum.\n\"So, what kind of youkai were they? Kappa? Tengu?\"\n\"They were humanoid, actually. Although physical form has no meaning in that world beyond anyway.\"\n\nBefore she could even think of trying to come to a mutual understanding, Merry awoke from her dream."
 th_arc.14.a: "..."
 th_arc.15.name: "Eternal Transient Reign"
 th_arc.15.desc: "Story Continues:\n\"Since we went to all this effort, how about we write it like a big climactic battle scene?\"\n\"I thought this was a history record.\"\n\"I think writing it like an epic would still go over well! All the history records from the Age of Discovery are practically tales of adventure, you know?\"\n\"Well, you're the one transcribing it, Renko, so I guess it's fine.\"\n\"All right. With that in mind, let's resume gathering material, Merry... or should I say, 'Dr. Latency'?\"\n\"...Are we seriously going with that pen name? It's kind of embarrassing...\"\n\"I mean, you're a professor who saw the world within the quantum gaps! It's totally fitting. \nNot to mention it's genderless and feels both Western and Eastern too\"\n\nWith the book's contents being what they were, all identifying details about the author were omitted. Anyone could see that it was an odd publication, but maybe it would become popular with some fans of pseudoscientific texts. Nonetheless, it was a true story."

 th_arc.16.desc: "Story Ends.\n\nMaybe a long time passed, or just an instant, But our scientists have been able to re-control their body. After recovered, in the depth of this ruin, they find what might be the origin of all these events...\n\n§MNaturalis Historia§!"

 th_arc.16001.a: "Good."

 th_arc.17.desc: "After they getting into the ruin, it suddenly shocked. Meanwhile the people outside also lose the contact with inner. For safety, we can not send the second team instantly, and instead of it is, we should discuss about these abnormal firstly.\n\n(§YTo dig this Archaeological Site, you need to take next steps: Choose this ruin in the menu 'Intel Log(F2)' -> check the site -> Manually assign scientists to dig§!)"
