 spth_astral_rift.1.desc: "We found the location of the call and launched a rift probe to explore it. \nAs the probe entered the rift, everything seemed to be quiet. \n\nThe various data that were displayed on the screen just now\nGravitational field strength, cosmic radiation, magnetic flux, all disappeared suddenly\nThe sensor could not detect anything, so we could only open the baffle of the probe to cover the observation window\nClose your eyes and you can see the glittering golden space\nSee countless doors leading to wonderful places in the sky\n\nThere is a strange gap in front of us, and the crew senses the spiritual power escaping from it. \nShould we explore the gap first, or investigate the closed door?"

 spth_astral_rift.20: "§MDimensional Rift§!"
 spth_astral_rift.20.desc: "After entering the rift, we came to a strange space. \nThis is a small space in the virtual world that serves as a relay. It is wrapped in a barrier so it is quite safe. There is no need to worry about any strange virtual creatures invading. \n\nIn front of us is a dark and bottomless hole in the purple space. Its edge emits a white holy light. It turns out to be a barrier shaped like a cave. \n\"Go through this barrier and you will reach the $spth_precursor.makai$ area we are anchored in.\" \n\nThis barrier seems difficult to open. We can try to break through it with strong physical means. Of course, you can also try a less violent way, which may not trigger any strange mechanism?"
 spth_astral_rift.20.a: "breakthrough."
 spth_astral_rift.20.b: "Research."
 spth_astral_rift.21: "§RYuugenMagan§!"
 spth_astral_rift.21.desc: "Our approach to open the rift by force is proved to be a mistake.\n\nA strange entity appeared in front of us---A set of five spinning, independently-moving eyes, each connected with electric-like force and surrounded by strange glyph. In the middle of these five eyes is a fuzzy projection of a human-like entity. Our team named it as \"YuugenMagan\", then we were attacked by this strange entity.\n\nUncountable amount of knife and rice danmaku were launched from surrounding four eyes, then the middle eye immediately emitted two powerful rays of plasma jet, strafing back and forth. Our escorts suffered great losses facing this cheating danmaku.\n\nWe must send our fleet for reinforcement; else we might lose the entire exploration team..."
 spth_astral_rift.21.a: "Send reinforcement"
 spth_astral_rift.22: "§RShockwave of magic power§!"
 spth_astral_rift.22.desc: "After a long period of research, we are about to successfully remove the barrier around this rift. \n\nHowever, at this moment, a strong magic power rushed out from it and reverberated in the virtual space that served as a relay. Then we lost all signals with the exploration team. After a long time, the communication was slowly restored, but it was greatly disturbed. We learned that the exploration team members suffered varying degrees of injuries due to the impact of this force - ranging from minor abrasions and contusions to minor fractures. \n\nAt the same time, the barrier that isolates other spaces in the virtual world was also damaged to a certain extent, and some psychic entities from the virtual world invaded, and the environment of the virtual world also interfered with the communication. It took them a long time to clean up these psychic entities and re-reinforce the barrier. \n\nPerhaps we need to exclude the medical team to assist in the treatment, and prepare two or three cents of pension..."
 spth_astral_rift.22.a: "Send a medical team."
 spth_astral_rift.23: "§MGateway to Makai§!"
 spth_astral_rift.23.desc: "At the same time, the barrier was completely lifted, and a strange door slowly emerged from the crack, and then slowly replaced the crack itself. Passing through this demon door, you can go to the space we anchored. \n\nOur team decided to study this door first, and also repair it for a period of time, and then go in to explore the area we anchored."
 spth_astral_rift.23.a: "learn."
 spth_astral_rift.24: "§MRuins of Weiner§!"
 spth_astral_rift.24.desc: "We passed through the gate of the demon world. \n\nThis is a purple space with ruins of buildings scattered randomly, and the horizon in the distance seems to be dominated by brown. \nThis space has a high concentration of spiritual energy. One of us suggested that we could investigate and station here, and explore other areas later. \n...\n\nAfter stationing and exploring for a while, we found a strange demon human wandering aimlessly in the ruins. She has purple wings, a red skirt and headdress, and a staff with a white star-shaped top in her left hand. When we recorded it and prepared to observe further, we found that she rushed towards us at high speed. The escort troops immediately broke out in battle with her, and after suffering minor casualties, we finally defeated the girl. \n\nShe called herself Iris, an \"innocent demon\", and the reason for fighting us was just because she was bored after not seeing a living person for too long. Then she transformed into a red-eyed purple bat and flew away."
 spth_astral_rift.24.a: "WHAT?"
 spth_astral_rift.25: "§MFallen Temple§!"
 spth_astral_rift.25.desc: "After defeating Iris, we headed to the brown area in the distance. \n\nThe sky was a decaying brown, and a sun was rising in the distance. Under the golden light was a dilapidated temple with Christian colors. Unlike the holy appearance from a distance, there were many strange demonic words and murals when we looked closely. One of them seemed to reveal that the owner of this temple had some kind of close relationship with the demon we defeated earlier, while the other murals were all themed on death and yin-yang jade. All of this was really uncomfortable. \n\nThen we found the door of the temple, pushed it open and stepped into the temple. It seemed that brown and purple fires were burning inside, and spheres of different sizes were suspended in the air."
 spth_astral_rift.25.a: "Proceed"
 spth_astral_rift.26: "§MSariel§!"
 spth_astral_rift.26.desc: "The inside of the temple is much larger than it looks. \n\nIn the middle is a statue of a girl—she wears a long dress and has three pairs of white wings, resembling the \"Seraphim\" recorded in Christianity. A vague Latin inscription is engraved on the base of the statue. Our team members approached and deciphered its content: \"Quod superius macroprosopus, quod inferius microprosopus\". \nAt this time, a fantasy suddenly appeared out of thin air. It seems that the abnormal spiritual environment has distorted the time here, allowing us to observe things that have already happened. \n\nA priestess is fighting with an angel here. Through the conversation, we know that this angel is Sariel, who is enshrined in this temple. From the beautiful night sky, to the river with two floating yin and yang gems, to a hell with human arms all over the ground, and finally several spherical objects that reflect the priestess and her shrine. And that priestess is—\n\nReimu Hakurei. \n\nEverything about this demon world is even more confusing."
 spth_astral_rift.26.a: "What on earth is this?"
 spth_astral_rift.23.desc.1: "The support troops soon arrived in the virtual space. \nThe enemy and our barrage of bullets continued to fire and interweave in the narrow space, painting a beautiful and deadly scene. \n\nWe finally defeated this \"Phantom Eye\" after paying a heavy casualty. $spth_astral_rift.23.desc$"
 spth_astral_rift.23.desc.2: "The medical team quickly arrived at the virtual space. \nThe injured team members were quickly treated. After the spiritual power impact, the integrity of the barrier dropped significantly and was constantly collapsing. \n\nA humanoid creature emerged from it and said in a vague and illusory voice - \"I am the guard of the gate to the demon world, the Phantom Eye. Very good, you have passed the test, and I will open this area to you.\" Then the girl's figure suddenly disappeared, $spth_astral_rift.23.desc$"
