Meanwhile a voice sounded in their ears: \n \"All right, most of the work is done.\"\n\"So all that's left is the personal account and the essay, then. Or perhaps I should say, your parts are the only ones we haven't made progress on, Merry.\"\n\"Whoops. Found out, did you?\"\n\"Remind me which of us suggested this project to begin with?\"\n\n\nMuch like how an excess supply of goods causes the goods' value to drop, all of humanity coming into wealth is equivalent to rich people disappearing from the world. Ever since the digitization of information, one could obtain vast quantities of it nigh-instantaneously. At the same time, things like speed and volume, which had held absolute authority since primitive times, lost their value. What gained value in exchange was quality. More than anything else, special information held by only a select few was what excited society's qualitative celebrities."

So when one said \"book\", they meant one made of paper.\n\nAt the suggestion of Maribel Hearn (Merry), the two decided to make a book about the mysterious worlds they had seen.
