 spth_ap.0.normal.desc: "It has been a while since the unification of the planets. During this period of time when the people of Gensokyo and the people of the modern world adapted to each other, many things happened. Both sides deeply realized that there were significant differences between each other and themselves in terms of life style and social form. Although it was Gensokyo that unified the world in the end, the modern humans are not without their own strengths. No matter what the reason, the human side has little resistance to the unification of Gensokyo. There is no doubt that their overall strength is not weaker than that of Gensokyo. Gensokyo cannot give up the power of science called science on the human side, nor can it give up the spiritual power system that is closely related to itself. Therefore, under the suggestion of knowledgeable people, we decided to carry out spiritual transformation in related aspects and named it the Ten-Year Plan."

 spth_ap.1.name: "Spiritual transformation - industry"
 spth_ap.1.d.desc: "The spiritual transformation cannot be achieved overnight. Because of the strategic direction of industrial spiritual transformation, many beings in Gensokyo began to enter the factory to learn. Even the superficial use of spiritual power can speed up the production speed of the factory. However, with the current level of spiritual power application in Gensokyo, resources cannot be generated out of nothing. The sudden burst of production capacity has caused a sudden increase in the demand for raw materials and electricity. In order to meet the growing industrial needs, we have gathered a large number of Gensokyo residents who have the ability to change terrain and accelerate construction, and opened up new power production and mineral mining areas on the planet."
 spth_ap.1.a: "Hope it helps"

Many weak monsters were recognized by others in the process and believed that they had found their own value of existence. Humans could not help but sigh with emotion. Later, the global atmosphere was activated by this construction movement, and slogans such as \"We workers have power\" were put forward."
 spth_ap.1.b.desc: "The new power and mining zoning has increased production supply, and the enthusiasm of the people has increased the output of raw materials. As a result, the factory's output cannot keep up with the growth of input. Whether for the reason of increasing production or providing more places for spiritual transformation experiments, we have decided to set aside another area to build an industrial zone."
 spth_ap.1.c.desc: "After a long period of spiritual transformation experiments, we have made certain breakthroughs in how to apply spiritual power to industrial production. With the help of the power of some special beings, if we continue to fill the production line with spiritual power, the factory will form a certain self-awareness. This is a kind of existence similar to the Tsukumogami but with a completely different formation method. And as long as the spiritual power supply does not stop, the production line will produce and maintain itself according to instinct, and its speed is not slower than the manual assembly line. If there are people to assist in providing spiritual power adjustments, the production speed can be further improved. However, out of consideration for social harmony and spiritual power needs, we only implement spiritual power automated production in a few areas. But there is one thing that is beyond doubt, that is, our spiritual power transformation has indeed achieved results."

Another part of the old and stubborn or newly converted vampires believed that it was the responsibility of all vampires to revive the glory of the vampires. We have no choice but to do so. The vampires' natural strong power is the grace of our ancestors. \nHowever, no matter how heatedly they argued, they also needed to consider the opinions of Remlia, the current supreme leader and the vampire's strongest fighting force."

Then she ordered the rest of her supporters who decided to follow her to pierce the bodies with spears and stand them near the tower where the meeting was held, recreating the legend of her ancestor, the Piercer.\nAfterwards, she started a rectification movement within the vampires, purifying the thoughts within the vampires and determining the future development direction of the vampires. At the same time, she opened up the ritual qualifications for the conversion of foreigners into vampires, providing a channel for all those who desire power and want to dedicate themselves to Gensokyo. After this, I believe that all citizens will begin to know Remlia again."

Although spiritual power is an energy that every Fantasy Town resident can produce, the amount of spiritual power of each person is obviously different. The spiritual power of a powerful monster can make ordinary people or monsters frightened just by leaking a little. \nAt the same time, because of the existence of spiritual power, the unstable factors in society have become more uncontrollable and more numerous than the original human society. For development reasons, we may be able to control the spiritual power of Fantasy Town on the grounds of public security, forcibly set spiritual power restrictions and extraction devices on powerful and dangerous beings, and try to arrange positions that require spiritual power to work for those with weaker spiritual power to reduce the spiritual power supply to various basic places, so that every spiritual power can be used as much as possible. However, this will make the Fantasy Town residents who are accustomed to their previous lives extremely dissatisfied, and it may also cause a general sense of distrust of the government in the country. This measure is not very consistent with the duties of the Hakurei Miko. Is it necessary to do so?"

 spth_ap.201.name: "Hakurei Restoration - Spell Card Rules"
 spth_ap.201.desc: "The spell card rules were popularized during the Red Mist Incident. They were a rule designed to better resolve conflicts between beings with certain powers. Due to the restrictions of the spell card rules, weak monsters may also defeat strong monsters. However, it is also because of this that the Hakurei Miko, who is undoubtedly the most powerful in Gensokyo, is also at risk of failure. Although in her previous life, Reimu only regarded her defeat as a spice in life to add interest to her previously invincible career, the symbolic meaning of the Hakurei Miko today is different from usual. If the spell card rules are not abolished, the failure of the Hakurei Miko, who symbolizes the human side, will bring an impact on people's sense of security. However, if the spell card rules are abolished, the Hakurei Miko will undoubtedly be an outsider in Gensokyo. Even now that the great barrier has disappeared, the Hakurei Miko can use the power of Hakurei to crush other monsters. Therefore, we now have two choices. One is to completely abolish the old spell card rules, so that the Hakurei Miko has unparalleled power in the territory. The other choice is to innovate the old spell card rules, while ensuring that the possibility of \"the strongest and undefeated\" disappears, it can also ensure that the dominance of the Hakurei Miko in the territory does not decline."
 spth_ap.201.a: "Cancel the spell card rule, Hakurei is not allowed to fail in the territory"

The new version of the spell card rules refers to some of the original spell card rules, and also established a relatively loose but extremely wide-ranging ranking system, dividing all residents in the territory into several ranks. Except for a very small number of people at the top, the rest of the people can spontaneously fight each other, and the scores are adjusted based on the comprehensive values ​​of each link in the duel. While ensuring the top dominance, it also ensures the enthusiasm of the people across the country for fighting.

Due to the limitations of the knowledge level of the managers who reviewed the reports, we did not know that Asakura Rikako had conducted many repeated experiments in her previous reports. In Asakura Rikako's final report, it was mentioned that the same experiment conducted by different leaders and staff might result in completely different results, which is contrary to the scientific view of the world. The spiritual power that played a key role in it was completely different from our previous guess. It was actually just a kind of energy that was common among the people of Gensokyo. The most critical link that ultimately determined the form of spiritual power was the person who exercised the power himself. \n\"To put it in terms that even monkeys can understand, spiritual power is just electricity. We monsters and people with super powers are different kinds of electrical appliances. Although electrical appliances are classified, each individual is still different, which will also affect the final result. Therefore, in the process of using spiritual power, the most important thing is not spiritual power, but people.\"\n\"The spiritual power of magicians is magic power, the spiritual power of monsters is demon power, the spiritual power of witches and others is spiritual power, the super power is mental power, and so on. The spiritual power itself is the same. The difference is the user.

This process cannot be stopped spontaneously. If you want to erase this mark, you must release the spiritual power and let it be assimilated by nature in the natural environment. \"In a sense, this may be a mark left by nature. In short, everyone's spiritual power is different.\"\n\"In addition, although different people have different spiritual powers, similar people also have similar spiritual powers. For example, the spiritual power of a magician, which we call magic power, is different from other people's magic power, but when releasing the same magic, it can produce similar effects. This is because the release of magic mainly requires the spiritual power itself and the breath that is biased towards the magician. Therefore, magic books and other items or weapons that can be stimulated by universal spiritual power are already engraved with the magician's mark when they are manufactured, so they only need the spiritual power itself.\"\n\nAfterwards, Patchouli's report became increasingly profound, and we ordinary people could no longer understand it.
