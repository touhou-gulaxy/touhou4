 th_arc.5.desc: "When our researchers entered the site to explore, the vision of all the people changed, and after a trance, they found that they had come to a strange place, but they couldn't move. Meanwhile a voice sounded in their ears: \n \"All right, most of the work is done.\"\n\"So all that's left is the personal account and the essay, then. Or perhaps I should say, your parts are the only ones we haven't made progress on, Merry.\"\n\"Whoops. Found out, did you?\"\n\"Remind me which of us suggested this project to begin with?\"\n\n\nMuch like how an excess supply of goods causes the goods' value to drop, all of humanity coming into wealth is equivalent to rich people disappearing from the world. Ever since the digitization of information, one could obtain vast quantities of it nigh-instantaneously. At the same time, things like speed and volume, which had held absolute authority since primitive times, lost their value. What gained value in exchange was quality. More than anything else, special information held by only a select few was what excited society's qualitative celebrities."

There's no dystopia more dull than a world where everything works out just how everyone wants it.\"\n\n\nIn a world where the digitization of info had progressed to its limits, there was no such thing as an e-book. \"E-books\" were nothing more than things created based on original, physical books. So when one said \"book\", they meant one made of paper.\n\nAt the suggestion of Maribel Hearn (Merry), the two decided to make a book about the mysterious worlds they had seen. It seemed that they had come to realize that the worlds they saw weren't just dreams."

The things Merry saw, too, had sometimes been diagnosed as delusions brought on by a virus.\nHowever, while relaxing with drinks, they sometimes thought: If things are denied because they can't be seen, then unobservable physical principles and astronomical objects far out of reach may as well be bunk, too.\nIn the opinion of Usami Renko, Merry is a truth-ist who can make those crazy physicists come to their senses. Since those are all facts that dominate the world, couldn't they go so far as to call Merry's visions truth surpassing those facts? To Renko Usami, Merry appeared to be a scholar of truth, who would open the eyes of all the delusion-spouting physicists.\n\n\"If ​​writing it out is a pain, how about dictating it for now?

Particularly interesting was that despite this, they can apparently still communicate with each other.\nMerry started to tell a mysterious story. It was about a strange world that only some humans could see. Not only was it extremely small, but our common sense didn't apply there. A bizarre world where elementary particles flew across boundaries of both time and space.\n\n\"...By 'only some humans,' do you mean physicists?\"\n\"Correct. Good on you, Renko.

But when I think of something that can't be seen, yet definitely exists as a phenomenon, I'd say 'youkai' is the best descriptor.\"\n\nThe existence of youkai certainly had been supported since long ago.

Shrines and the like were definitely holy ground.\nMerry said she saw a cat at a shrine.\nHowever, the cat never caught anyone's attention and freely passed through objects.\nMerry knew what it was at once. It was a youkai cat, she said, lurking within quantum gaps.\n\n\"Huh, a quantumly-unobservable cat...\nUntil it's observed, it's both alive and dead.\nJust like Schrödinger's Cat.\"\n\"Although since I observed it, that determined it was alive.\""

If I could just get the hang of it, I could easily cross over.\"\n\"Maybe that transit-resisting 'something' could be the Sanzu River?\"\n\"The people from long ago who could see probably did name it that, yes\"\nPerhaps a brane is something like a dyed object exposed to the flow of a river. \nThe patterns dyed on the object flow down the river and transfer to another object. Merry's behavior might be that sort of thing, simply put. Of course, it's hardly simple to do.\nBut when the pattern seeps into the other object, what happens?\nIt'd probably be seen as just a stain, not a pattern.\n\n(\"...if contaminants get mixed in, they've got to be eliminated\")\n\n\" Huh? What's wrong, Merry? You seem miles away.\"\n\"Oh, what? Sorry, where was I?\"\n\"You were talking about the things you saw in the \"world beyond\" .

I suppose it is only natural that they'd realize I'm a foreign presence. Like I see youkai as fluctuations,\nperhaps they see me as a phantom-like being. \"\nShe said the attacking youkai came soaring through the sky, just like formless quantum particles racing to and fro in a vacuum.\n\"So, what kind of youkai were they?
