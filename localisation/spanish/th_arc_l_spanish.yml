 th_arc.5.desc: "When our researchers entered the site to explore, the vision of all the people changed, and after a trance, they found that they had come to a strange place, but they couldn't move. Meanwhile a voice sounded in their ears: \n \"All right, most of the work is done.\"\n\"So all that's left is the personal account and the essay, then. Or perhaps I should say, your parts are the only ones we haven't made progress on, Merry.\"\n\"Whoops. Found out, did you?\"\n\"Remind me which of us suggested this project to begin with?\"\n\n\nMuch like how an excess supply of goods causes the goods' value to drop, all of humanity coming into wealth is equivalent to rich people disappearing from the world. Ever since the digitization of information, one could obtain vast quantities of it nigh-instantaneously. At the same time, things like speed and volume, which had held absolute authority since primitive times, lost their value. What gained value in exchange was quality. More than anything else, special information held by only a select few was what excited society's qualitative celebrities."

There's no dystopia more dull than a world where everything works out just how everyone wants it.\"\n\n\nIn a world where the digitization of info had progressed to its limits, there was no such thing as an e-book. \"E-books\" were nothing more than things created based on original, physical books. So when one said \"book\", they meant one made of paper.\n\nAt the suggestion of Maribel Hearn (Merry), the two decided to make a book about the mysterious worlds they had seen.

Since those are all facts that dominate the world, couldn't they go so far as to call Merry's visions truth surpassing those facts?

 th_arc.77.desc: "首先能汇总出的信息是，一些对于方尖碑的记录，它们提到这座方尖碑是用于实验将灵能用于强化灵力能力的装置，并且原本是深埋于地下的，可能是因为星球的地质活动使其重见天日。§H[Root.GetLeaderName]§!注意到，在月都因为一些意外撤离这里的研究人员与殖民者时，曾经因为方尖碑的灵能活动导致整个星球被短暂的吞入了虚境之中。\n\n而在进入了虚境之后，为了面对其中的灵能活动，这座研究所的研究人员选择了将尚未稳定的生命灵能化技术应用在了自己身上。而在这之后的记录则明显存在着时间断层，编纂者也发生了改变，根据§H[Root.GetLeaderName]§!的推测之后的记录可能是这颗星球以某种方式脱离了虚境后，月都进行的记录。"
