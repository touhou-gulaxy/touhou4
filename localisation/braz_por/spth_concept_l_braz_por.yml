 spth_word_concept_weapon_use_target_desc: "This determines whether this weapon retargets enemy because other weapon will kill target prior to this weapon, causing a waste of damage.\nEnabling this might increase valid damage under some circumstances, as targeting efficiency is increased(to avoid wasting damage). But this also lowers firing rate as more time taken for retargeting.\nDisabling this cause weapon to keep firing at any time instead of retargeting to prevent wasting damage. As mentioned above, this causes invalid damage(wasting damage on those died).\nMost vanilla and modded weapons are defaulted to enable."
