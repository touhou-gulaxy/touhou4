There's still a fool making trouble in the Mist Lake, so it's not suitable to go there. There are no cars at this time,\" she replied. Is this building called the Scarlet Devil Mansion? It's quite majestic. \"From your appearance, you are Chinese, right?\" Yes, just like I can see that she is East Asian, she can also see my ancestry at a glance, but her eyesight is much sharper than mine. \n\"It's okay, I brought outdoor accommodation equipment.\" \"That's good, I haven't seen my compatriots for a long time, let's chat for a while.\" \"I'm happy to do it.\" \nJust like this, I have been wandering around the Scarlet Devil Mansion these days with this girl named Hong Meiling."

 toho.8001.desc: "The news that the Terakoya was going to change the original classroom model has spread all over the streets and alleys of the Human Village, and even attracted the attention of the Youkai. \n The residents who pay the most attention should be the children in the Human Village. After all, Sensei Keine's teaching cannot be said to be very boring, but can only be said to be obscure. And even the fairies seem to have taken a great interest in the class - the fairies have gradually become mild, and the they have begun to be active among humans. \n However, the Chancellor of Terakoya, Sensei Keine Kamishirazawa, revealed that the new teaching model is in urgent need of new textbooks...Whether or not she can hire professional teachers is also a big question."
 toho.8001.aa: "A Gensokyo people's education publishing house will be set up and the compilation of teaching materials will begin immediately."
 toho.8001.bb: "If some famous people could be invited, maybe oral teaching would be enough?"
 th_event.8002.name: "Is it necessary to write about the future history?"
 th_event.8002.desc: "The preparation of the history handouts is progressing smoothly because of the previous handout references. The lecture notes on history are divided into three parts: ancient history, modern history, and future history. \nEveryone thinks that the teaching of future history is redundant, and ancient history and modern history can fill in the void of history for Gensokyo residents. Moreover, the history of Gensokyo is mostly oral history, and the sources of first-hand historical materials are close to legendary stories, and there are no historical materials about the future at all. \nBut Teacher Keine adheres to the occult ideas of yesterday, present, and tomorrow, and said that, today's people remember the past, but they lack confidence in the future; The history of the past is indeed clear and clear, but the history of the future needs to find the direction from the chaos and darkness of the future. \"The road to home is very fantasy and bright, but if always reminiscing about the past would not create the future.\""
 th_event.8002.aa: "Let's try it first."
 th_event.8003.name: "The Perfect Blend of Science and Magic"
 th_event.8003.desc: "The reason for the trial printing of the natural handouts was that in order to highlight the characteristics of the discipline, the \"editors-in-chief\" produced lecture notes that were completely different in terms of paper size, book shape, font color , and writing characteristics, and the materials used to make the book were even more varied. The guy in charge of writing magic parts asked for ink that could only be made inside the Forest of Magic... Only one of the large thread-bound books, titled \"The Principle of Ordinary Rings\", is rectangular, and the book's unnamed author says that the book cover automatically corrects the conflict between magic and technology in the book, but there is also a strange request: the book cover must be made of bamboo pulp paper, otherwise it will fail."
 th_event.8003.aa: "The rabbits are going to make a fortune again this time."
 th_event.8004.name: "Encyclopedic Teaching Handouts"
 th_event.8004.desc: "The agricultural science handouts were the easiest part. Farmers among humans, kappas who planted cucumbers, and even fairies in the flower fields all participated in the preparation of the handouts. Sure enough, agriculture is still the survival foundation of Gensokyo. \nHowever, more people came to help with the preparation, and the thin booklet gradually became as big as a brick. The content also expanded from simple agricultural production to meteorology, divination, agricultural machinery manufacturing, household plants, water conservancy engineering... It seems that everyone does not want their skills to be lost, so they sell their own goods by using the agricultural science that people are most familiar with. \nIt just feels like this handout is about to become an encyclopedia. If the students are under too much pressure, they can only split it into volumes."
 th_event.8004.aa: "Encyclopedias are more popular in Gensokyo"
 th_event.8005.name: "Elective and Compulsory Arrangements for Mathematics Lecture Notes"
 th_event.8005.desc: "After investigating the average math level in Gensokyo, the general lack of math knowledge among the residents of Gensokyo made it difficult to write the book. \n However, after reading a large number of books from the Bavaru Library and Suzunaian, and after a long period of disappearance, the writing committee finally handed over a dozen books that were said to be \"rushed out within a month\" after a one-day extension. They covered all the math content from 1+1 to high-order differential equations. The speed of writing really made people wonder if they were directly copied from external books. However, the cover was randomly colored, and the nested design of using an inexplicable machine to display the content of the book gave people the feeling that \"they are really rushing to work.\" \n More than a dozen books, and even a strict distinction between must-learn and optional must-learn, are really a headache."
 th_event.8005.aa: "How did they improve so quickly in math?"
 th_event.8006.name: "All Gensokyo is Speaking in The [Data Deleted]"
 th_event.8006.desc: "Do the monsters have their own language? This question was raised at the beginning. The diverse composition of the residents has become a difficulty in compiling reading and writing textbooks. Speaking of which, everyone in Gensokyo can understand each other's language, and there seems to be no natural language boundary. Obviously, the races are different... So the editors simply think that there is only one language in Gensokyo, and everyone in Gensokyo speaks [DATA EXPUNGED]!"
 th_event.8006.aa: "I never noticed it before - is there even a dialect?"
 toho.8007.name: "Handouts of equal height"
 toho.8007.desc: "The students of Terakoya received the first set of new textbooks, including three standard history books, several odd-shaped general knowledge textbooks, encyclopedias published in separate volumes, math handouts and character recognition books that had been stored for several months. It was not easy for the children, because these books were almost as tall as their height. \n Originally, they should have been distributed by grade. When the teachers of Terakoya realized this, the students seemed to have accepted so much teaching: \"Will we learn so many things? I'm looking forward to it.\" Perhaps for the children, the huge amount of new things is not a pressure. For the children in Gensokyo, knowledge is more of an attractive spell. \nThe textbooks themselves are not written in a serious manner. Almost every paragraph has a different style: habitual complaints, strange habits, lengthy arguments for true and false propositions, illustrations that are more for entertainment than for imparting knowledge, as well as sophisticated experimental formulas, detailed historical records, and carefully annotated astrological calendars... All the books stacked together form the entire Gensokyo, and you can tell who wrote them at a glance. Such a distinctive writing style can probably only be seen in Gensokyo. While showing personality without reservation, it is integrated into a big book without any violation. This is the incredible part of Gensokyo."
 toho.8007.aa: "Let's redistribute the books by grade group."

Among them, the huge collision between the two galaxies that formed our galaxy was described by the epic as a planned war. \nEpics are inevitably exaggerated, and perhaps this ancient god is also.

Because the code of other works was also found in the storage disk, but these contents were strangely split into two sections, because the storage disk also suffered such damage and was split in half. \n\nAs we continued to explore, we found that there were many tools and weapons that imitated the abilities of the girls in Gensokyo scattered in the base. Including the living area, there are a lot of Touhou secondary creations here. They must have been impressed by the charm of the Touhou project, which made this place a fan creation center for this alien race. \n\nAs the investigation progressed, the reason for the abandonment of the base was also revealed. At an alien Touhou exhibition, they routinely held a competition. However, this competition invited players from the opponent country to ease the relationship between the two countries, but the winner of the opponent country behaved badly, and the behavior of whipping corpses and squatting heads caused the aliens to be disgusted, so there was a substantial exchange of fire on the scene, and the exhibition was in chaos.

However, with the rapid expansion, it became more and more difficult for the core parts that could no longer expand to compete with the border parts that could continue to expand outward, which made the Ancient Civilization gradually lose the ability to control the extragalactic galaxies in the border parts, and the contact and war with the Zroni Civilization during this period accelerated this process. Eventually, at the end of the ['spth_ag_concept_Prosperity_age'], civil wars broke out in the Zroni Civilization and the involvement of Ancient Civilization, resulting in changes in the psionic environment that drastically reduced the productivity of each galaxy, causing the already unstable situation to spiral out of control."

However, with the change of the times, the common identity of Ancient Civilization completely collapsed, and since the late Psionic ['spth_ag_concept_age'], the attempts of various forces to consciously get rid of their dependence on psionic energy have finally worked, and the stability of the psionic environment has gradually improved the security situation within each galaxy, and the motivation of Ancient Civilization to unite to deal with crises has also weakened.
