 leader_trait_tenshi_desc: "Once the eldest daughter of the Hinanawi clan, she ascended into heaven and became celestials along with the Hinanawi clan. However, because she became celestials by serving the Nawi clan, as opposed to training, she lacked the reputation or discipline expected of a celestial and hence was labeled as \"delinquent\" celestials. Her Sword of Scarlet Thought adapts to the opponent's vulnerabilities by taking specific forms of weather and striking them accurately."
