The space station is equipped with a mechanism that can automatically fly to and park at the Lagrange point. This mechanism takes into account the possibility of the space station losing control due to an accident, but its propulsion device remains intact. Additionally, it considers preventing the space station from descending to Earth and facilitating future recovery.\n\nStrangely, TORIFINE began orbiting Earth under the influence of an unexplained force, instead of parking at the Earth-Moon Lagrange point.

 touhou_makai_chain_poi.1.desc: "This is an outpost of the mysterious civilization $spth_precursor.makai$, which originated from another world created by §M$spth_precursor.shinki$§!. Scientists believe that they can use the equipment in the outpost to create a space-time rift that can be anchored in $spth_precursor.makai$ to continue exploring."
 spth_precursor.100.desc: "We found some magical relics and ruined buildings in §Y[From.GetName]§!, and the language of this civilization is almost exactly the same as ours. According to research, this place actually belongs to a civilization that calls itself \"$spth_precursor.makai$\", and has powerful magic and spiritual power like us. It is understood that this civilization often stays in another world created by a powerful entity \"§M$spth_precursor.shinki$§!\" in their civilization, and this seems to be one of their outposts. \n\nSince $spth_precursor.makai$ and we do not exist in the same reality, we need to use a special device on this planet to open a space rift and explore through this channel. Due to the special reality structure of this galaxy, it is expected that our scientific research team will be able to open the rift within a few months."

With subsequent progress, we will definitely be able to carry out larger-scale operations."

 spth_precursor.101.desc: "The research team has completed the analysis of the relics and equipment on §Y[From.GetName]§!. Through reasonable manipulation and spiritual power infusion, we have successfully opened a rift on §Y[From.GetName]§!. A space rift opened on the planet. We felt abundant spiritual power. It seems that the opposite side will be very suitable for our actions. Next, we just need to send a scientific team to explore. \n\nDue to insufficient information, this rift in time and space leading to another world can only be anchored in a small area in the $spth_precursor.makai$ world. We believe that as the secrets of $spth_precursor.makai$ are discovered, we can gradually begin a larger-scale exploration of $spth_precursor.makai$."

The once prosperous city is now only a pile of broken walls and ruins. Due to the spiritual environment here, it is difficult for animals and plants to survive, so there is a strange sight of vegetation outside the ruins and only building debris inside. The surface of the planet seems to have traces of orbital bombardment, and it is difficult for us to imagine what happened here. \n\nResearchers believe that studying this abandoned colony can allow us to obtain more information and clues about $spth_precursor.makai$."

 spth_precursor.106.desc: "There is a crashed space station on the surface of [From.GetName], believed to have been a planetary orbital station of $spth_precursor.makai$. \nThe probe discovered a strange scene: the broken hull was undergoing phase shifts, sometimes appearing in our plane, sometimes disappearing and hiding in another plane. \n\nOur scientists speculate that it should be undergoing phase shifts between an anchor point of [From.GetName] and $spth_precursor.makai$, and perhaps we can try to stabilize the reality and stop the phase shift phenomenon. They believe that studying this space station can allow us to obtain more information and clues about $spth_precursor.makai$."

 spth_precursor.114.desc: "We have collected enough information. \n\nResearch shows that $spth_precursor.makai$ actually originated from our universe. After $spth_precursor.shinki$ used an item from another world line's Fantasy Township and their powerful magic to create another world, they moved their core to the $spth_precursor.makai$ world. It is precisely because $spth_precursor.makai$ is also related to the Fantasy Township of another world line that we encountered the scene when we first explored $spth_precursor.makai$. If we can locate the home galaxy of $spth_precursor.makai$, perhaps we can find the whereabouts of the secret treasure and obtain a more stable anchor point with the $spth_precursor.makai$ plane."
