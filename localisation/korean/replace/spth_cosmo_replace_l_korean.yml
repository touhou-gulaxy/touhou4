 crisis.7516.desc: "$crisis.7516.intro$This universe is already too old for the laws to be rewritten. While our dimension was several billion years older than this one, our tests show that the laws governing space here already display the resilience that will lead to our modifications being ultimately erased.\n\nNo matter what, we'll take the time to repair and adjust the ship, find another black hole, and dive in as many times as we have to. The multiverse beckons, and somewhere in its infinity, we shall create the perfect home."
 crisis.7516.desc.technosphere: "$crisis.7516.intro$The Gargantua universe is small. Impossibly so. Infinity fitting into nothingness. But our arrival has altered the state of things here. This universe has only just begun, as if our entry has prematurely forced it into being.\n\nIn this seedbed of creation lies the potential to build anything. Time is ours to wield, and eternity will be over soon enough."
 crisis.7516.desc.technosphere.pantagruel: "$crisis.7516.intro$The Infinity Machine's crossing has done much to help us understand the rules that govern the universes, and it also kick started the existence of this one. We emerged in a strangely familiar constellation, almost identical to the one we left. Next to us, a decayed Infinity Machine drifts lifelessly in the void. Millions of years have passed here since its coming and this dimension underwent a process of replication of our universe. The sentient sphere has already shaped this dimension and we are largely unable to affect it any further. Still, this universe offers prime settling grounds. We should first look into using the Needle to repurpose the Sphere then use the repaired Infinity Machine to do our bidding.\n\nAs the First Editor of this universe, it will definitely be able to enact more edits upon this reality."
 crisis.7516.desc.egress: "$crisis.7516.intro$Our entry point is murky, veiled... As our instruments return to full functionality, we perceive a cloud of nanites. None remain operational. Whatever sent them through, they did not survive the journey. But they could be repaired.\n\nEven better, this dimension appears quite receptive to our changes. A prime space to settle, really. Any changes we make will take time to enact, but with the help of the nanites, we should exponentially speed up the process."
 crisis.7516.desc.horror: "$crisis.7516.intro$Coming here was a §Rterrible§! mistake.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to describe: darkness and brutal nightmare; a sick, seeping malevolence that permeates the very fabric of space. For now, the Horizon Needle offers shelter. Edit after frenzied edit, we work to ward off the worst of the surrounding madness. But the coordinated assaults on our defenses betray a singular intent. A malignant mind, bent on our destruction.\n\nOne misstep could mean death, or worse. Can we hold on long enough to save ourselves? At home, we were like gods. Here, we are simply struggling to survive."
 crisis.7516.desc.center: "$crisis.7516.intro$Mist and creeping shadow; a haze permeates the fabric of this place. The feeling is familiar, a feverish energy, rippling with psionic potential. We have entered the Shroud.\n\nThere are powers here that are remain far, far beyond our own. Already, they are aware of us. In the shifting miasma, strange shapes bear omens of death.\n\nOur only hope is that reality here is thin, and prone to tears. With a swift edit, we open a transient doorway to take us... elsewhere. As the Horizon Needle dives, we finally understand the length of the road ahead.\""
 crisis.7516.desc.center.patron: "$crisis.7516.intro$Mist and seething shadow, and a gorgeous, purple haze. The feeling is familiar, a bountiful energy, rippling with psionic potential. We have entered the Shroud.\n\nOur patron is here, of course. They were not expecting us, but are amused by our arrival. They find our notions of shaping reality charming. Naturally, they will help.\n\nThey have promised a secluded pocket near the Shroud to do with as we please, much like what was once bequeathed to the one calling himself §Y$relic_zro_entity_name$§!. After all, we are our patron, and our patron is us. It is only natural to help oneself.\""
